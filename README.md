1. **Do not follow any standards.** Rules are for losers and you are not one. If there is a general practice guideline, completely ignore it and be a free spirit. 
2. **Be inconsistent.** Consistency in any shape or letter makes it easy for any developer to eventually figure you out. Roll a dice and toss a coin to determine your next move. Always aim to keep your co-workers on their toes. 
3. **Most importantly, make the code work.** If the code doesn't work, then it becomes tempting to start from scratch and your hard work will be for naught. If the code works but no one can interpret it, then it is inducted into the fabled *legacy code* and no one dares touch it.
